"""Navmesh invariant measurements, shared by the sweep/render/compare tools.

ONE definition of each invariant, so a render and a sweep can never disagree
about whether a cell is broken.  The invariants, and why each one exists:

  MISS     pathgrid sample with no navmesh under it.  The pathgrid is the
           authored ground truth; an uncovered walked line is always a failure.
  CRACK    a walked line crosses a BOUNDARY edge at similar z.  Plan coverage
           looks continuous but the two sides share no edge, so the engine
           cannot path across.  This is the in-game "hole in the stairs" that
           coverage numbers are blind to.
  CHOKE    the continuous covered cross-width along a walked line drops below
           half a doorway (48u).  Connectivity is NOT the metric: a passage
           an NPC cannot fit through is unwalkable even though the graph says
           it is connected.
  OVL      two triangles overlapping in plan at the same height (same-surface
           overlap) — the engine picks one arbitrarily.
  VERT     near-vertical triangles: walls, not floor.
  DMISS    door passage squares with no mesh: an NPC cannot use that door.
  BADNESS  shape contract, max(ratio/MAX_EDGE_RATIO, aspect/MAX_TRI_ASPECT).
