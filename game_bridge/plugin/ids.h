// Address Library stable IDs.
//
// Every ID here was derived by locating the target in the GOG/AE 1.6.659 build
// (the only non-DRM-packed copy, so the only one that disassembles statically)
// and inverting its RVA through versionlib-1-6-659-0.bin. The same ID then
// resolves on ANY build shipping a versionlib -- including the DRM-packed Steam
// 1.6.1170 the user actually plays. That is why nothing here is a raw RVA.
//
// VERIFIED translations (659 -> 1170), checked against both databases:
//   21964  CompileAndRun        0x303cf0  -> 0x343c20
//   368092 compilerNameTable    0x1e5cc70 -> 0x1ff2d60
//   386860 hkClass hkpRigidBody 0x1e8f798 -> 0x2025e78
//   387372 hkClass hkaRagdoll   0x1e90798 -> 0x2026e78
//
// Re-deriving one: find the address in the GOG exe, then
//   python tools/address_lib.py --rva <rva> --from 1.6.659
//
// !! Do NOT add "IDs" for globals like g_thePlayer / g_console by taking the
// nearest-below versionlib entry. Those live inside one enormous .data symbol
// (id 414365 on 1.6.640) at offsets of hundreds of KB, and that offset does not
// survive a rebuild -- it resolves to a plausible-looking wrong pointer, which
// is the worst failure mode this plugin can have. Reach such state through the
// console/Papyrus instead, or discover it via RTTI at runtime.

// This plugin used to pass nullptr there and select the reference by running
// `prid <id>` as a SEPARATE ExecOne first. That does not work: each ExecOne is
// its own compile+execute, so the selection does not survive into the next
// call. Proven with a controlled test on the player -- after `prid 00000014`,
// a bare `getpos x` printed NOTHING while `player.getpos x` printed a real

//         byte [rbp+0x600] = 1        <-- console-mode: makes handlers PRINT
