"""
Morrowind exterior geometry: cell grids, quadrants and the worldspace.

Morrowind has no WRLD record and one implicit exterior, located purely by a
cell's grid X/Y. Its cells are 8192 units across where Oblivion's are 4096, so
one Morrowind cell covers a 2x2 block of Oblivion cells.

World POSITIONS are carried across unchanged -- Morroblivion did not scale
them, measured on identical ref extents in both games. Only the grid changes,
and only because the cell size halved.
