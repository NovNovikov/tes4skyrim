"""
Morrowind groundcover plugins as real Skyrim grass.

Morrowind has no grass record. Groundcover mods place one static per clump --
2.73M of them in Aesthesia's Tamriel Rebuilt set -- because the engine offers
nothing else. Converting those literally yields millions of STAT references
Skyrim renders individually, with no instancing, LOD or wind.

Skyrim instead scatters grass procedurally per LANDSCAPE TEXTURE: a GRAS record
names the model, and an LTEX names the grasses that grow on it. So the
placements are inverted into that model -- sample the land texture under every
clump, tally which grasses grow on which texture, and emit the GRAS plus the
LTEX bindings that reproduce the distribution.

The terrain being sampled is never the plugin's own: a groundcover plugin
ships cells and statics only, never LAND, and its statics may be a master's.
