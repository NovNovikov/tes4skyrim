"""Ground models, and fitting rigid head gear onto the Skyrim skull.

A `_gnd` mesh is the dropped-item variant and takes the world-object path, not
the worn one; telling the two apart from the filename is the whole of the first
half. The second half measures a helmet or hood onto the target head rather
than scaling it, because a scale that fits the crown never fits the jaw.
