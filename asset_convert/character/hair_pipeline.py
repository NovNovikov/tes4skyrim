"""Oblivion hair -> Skyrim head-part (HDPT) meshes: the bake.

hair_plan decides WHICH variants a plugin needs (length step x gender x the
wearer's head family); this module bakes each one: the .tri HairMorph blended
in by the length's weight, the geometry fitted onto the Skyrim head of that
gender and family, then converted and given the Hair Tint shader.  Hair is a
separate stage because `meshes\\characters\\` is in nif_converter.SKIP_PATHS:
one source mesh becomes several outputs.
