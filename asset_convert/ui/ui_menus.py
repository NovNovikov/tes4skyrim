"""Oblivion menu art -> Skyrim Scaleform menus. Message boxes only, for now.

Oblivion draws its UI from XML "tiles" (`Data/Menus/*.xml`) over DDS art;
Skyrim drives Scaleform GFx movies (`Interface/*.swf`) whose ActionScript 2
classes are called from C++ by name.  There is no translation between the two
technologies, so nothing here converts a menu in the sense the rest of the
pipeline converts a record.  What it does instead is narrower and safe:

    RESKIN the vanilla movie in place, changing only character definitions.

Every AS2 class, every GameDelegate callback and the whole timeline are copied
through byte-for-byte (`asset_convert.ui.swf` round-trips an untouched movie
byte-identically, which `tests/test_ui_convert.py` asserts).  The engine's
interface contract with the movie therefore cannot drift -- the failure mode of
a bad reskin is "it looks wrong", never "the menu stopped responding".

WHY THE MESSAGE BOX IS THE ONE THAT PORTS CLEANLY
-------------------------------------------------
Both engines build this menu the same way: a 9-slice frame around a text block
with a stack of choices under it.

  * Oblivion (`menus/message_menu.xml` + `menus/prefabs/generic_background.xml`)
    draws a `_border_thickness`-thick border from three textures -- corners,
    a horizontal edge, a vertical edge -- around a stretched center, and the
    box is `user0` wide.  Its buttons are PLAIN CENTERED TEXT: the button image
    is `shared_empty.dds` at `alpha 0`, so there is no button art to port.
  * Skyrim's `messagebox.swf` has a `Background_mc` clip (character 11, holding
    shape 10) that `MessageBox.PositionElements` sizes to fit the text and
    buttons.

So the port is: compose Oblivion's whole frame -- center and border -- into ONE
bitmap on `Background_mc`'s shape, which the AS2 already sizes to the panel,
and set the layout margins from Oblivion's authored insets.  The selection
arrows become Oblivion's focus box and the text takes Oblivion's authored
color.

🛑 ONE BITMAP, ONE FILL.  Five in-game rounds narrowed the render path to a
single rule: this engine draws a shape's FIRST bitmap fill across the whole
shape and ignores the rest, and it did not draw characters this conversion
ADDS at all.  So the whole frame -- center and border -- is composed offline
into ONE bitmap on the shape vanilla already sizes, rather than nine rects or
separate clips.

The border is then 9-SLICED: `Background_mc` already carries a
`DefineScalingGrid`, and re-cutting that grid to our 44 px border keeps the
corners fixed while the middle stretches, so the carving holds its density at
any panel size.  (An earlier rule here claimed the engine will not 9-slice a
bitmap fill "0 of 353 shapes"; that census compared scaling grids, which name a
SPRITE, against fills, which live on a SHAPE -- disjoint kinds, so the zero was
arithmetic, not evidence.  Vanilla 9-slices bitmap art in magic/container/craft
menus.)  Full evidence, including what that costs: docs/commentary/asset_convert_ui.md.

WHAT IS NOT PORTED (and why)
----------------------------
* **Fonts.** Skyrim's message text imports `$EverywhereMediumFont` from
  `gfxfontlib.swf`, which is shared by EVERY menu -- replacing it is a
  whole-UI change, not a message-box one.  Oblivion's own faces are `.fnt`
  bitmap fonts, which do not scale and would have to be revectorised.  The
  text therefore stays in Skyrim's face; the frame is the dominant visual
  signature and it does port.
* **The `60` fallback margin** in `PositionElements` is patched (see
  `_LITERAL_PATCHES`), but any other unnamed literal in the AS2 is left alone.
* **Oblivion's fixed 700 px box width.** Skyrim sizes the panel to its content;
  pinning a minimum would mean recompiling AS2, not patching a literal.

# Since the scaling grid is re-cut to the border (see patch_message_box), the
# frame NO LONGER rides Background_mc's uniform scale -- the border draws at a
# constant 44 px whatever the panel size, so it can no longer outgrow the
# margins, and the base size is now a quality choice (blur/aspect) rather than
# the layout constraint it used to be. The note below is the history that set
# these numbers.
#
# 🛑 (HISTORICAL, pre-scale9) THE BASE MUST BE BIG ENOUGH THAT THE BORDER NEVER
# OUTGROWS THE MARGINS. The frame rode Background_mc's uniform scale, so a panel
# taller than the base drew the border THICKER than its authored 44 px, while
# the margins that keep text clear of it are fixed pixel values. Measured in
# game: a ten-choice menu is 762 px tall, which against a 488 px base scaled the
# border to 69 px against a HEIGHT_MARGIN of 59 -- and the last choice rendered
# on top
# of the border. A four-choice box scaled to 42 px and was fine, which is why
# it only ever went wrong with many options.
#
# The invariant is therefore
#
#     border * panel / base  <  margin        on each axis
#
# so base > border/margin * panel: 0.75x the tallest panel and 0.79x the
# widest. These values clear a 900x700 panel, well past anything observed.
#
# Supersampling was the obvious alternative and is the wrong trade: doubling
# the pixels quadruples the file to fix blur, while sizing the base fixes blur,
# aspect AND this overlap for a fraction of that.
#
# The sizes below cover a 700x1040 panel. Ten choices measured 762 px tall in
# game before the MessageText fix and about 707 after, so that is generous
# headroom rather than a guess.
CENTER_BASE_W = 472         # -> 560 px base, covers 700 px wide

# The center is composed at 1/N of the frame's resolution and scaled back up.

# It is the only slice with photographic detail, so it dominates the file --
# and it is also the slice Oblivion itself stretches hardest (a 1024x1024
