"""Oblivion's mouse cursor in Skyrim's menus.

Skyrim's `Interface/cursormenu.swf` draws the menu cursor as a SINGLE vector
shape -- character 1, a 42x42 shape placed at the movie origin. A cursor's
hotspot (the click point) is the movie's (0,0), and this shape's box is
x[0,42] y[0,42], so its TOP-LEFT CORNER is the hotspot -- exactly where a
pointer's tip belongs.

Oblivion draws its pointer from `textures/menus/misc/cursor.dds`: a 64x64
texture whose arrow art sits at the top-left with the tip in the corner (the
topmost opaque pixel is at x=1, the leftmost at y=2). Cropping to the art's
alpha bounds therefore puts the tip at the crop's top-left, and placing that
crop at the shape origin lands the tip on the hotspot.

So the port is the SAME one-shape swap the message-box frame uses (see
ui_menus / docs/commentary/asset_convert_ui.md): replace character 1 with a single
bitmap-filled shape of Oblivion's arrow, TOP-LEFT aligned rather than centered.
No ActionScript is touched, so the cursor tracks the mouse and hides in
gameplay exactly as vanilla -- the failure mode of a bad swap is "it looks
wrong", never "the cursor stopped moving".

This only affects the MENU cursor (inventory, map, message boxes, favorites);
there is no cursor during normal gameplay.
