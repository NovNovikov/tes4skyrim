"""Filesystem anchors for asset_convert, independent of package depth.

Every module resolves the repo root and the bundled data directory from here,
so moving a module into a subpackage cannot silently repoint it: deriving them
per-module from `__file__` breaks the moment the module's depth changes, and
one `generated/` site created an empty directory rather than raising.
