"""Reading mod archives (.zip / .7z / .rar) with the bundled 7-Zip.

Mod archives are downloaded from the internet, so every path inside one is
untrusted input. This module is the ONLY place archives are opened, and it
enforces two rules for the whole pipeline:

  * ``safe_relpath`` — every member path is normalized and rejected if it
    escapes the destination (``..``, absolute paths, drive letters, UNC).
    ``ZipFile.extractall`` is never used; 7-Zip is always given an explicit
    output directory and its results are re-checked on the way out.
  * listing is separate from extraction, so a caller can inspect an archive
    (member list, layout, plugin names) without writing anything to disk.

``.zip`` uses stdlib ``zipfile``: it streams members natively and needs no
subprocess. ``.7z`` and ``.rar`` go through ``external/7zip/7z.exe``.

NOTE: the bundled 7-Zip is ``7z.exe`` + ``7z.dll``, NOT the standalone
``7za.exe`` — RAR support lives in the DLL and the standalone build cannot read
RAR at all. See ``external/7zip/BUILD.md``.
