"""A quest-owned package must never appear in an NPC's PKID list.

xEdit states the rule outright:

    NDAnvilListenProphetGogan8x4 [PACK:02002D7C]
    error: package is owned by quest ND00 and cannot be assigned to an npc
    record

Such a package reaches its actor through the quest's reference alias (ALPC).
Knights.esp shipped `PACK 02002D7C` in the PKID list of `NPC_ 0103AF03`
(Gogan) and the game froze at the main menu; removing it fixed the freeze
(confirmed in-game 2026-08-26).

The normal converter path (packages.npc_packages) always filtered these.  The
OVERRIDE path derived its exclusion set from the master alone, so a package
the PLUGIN newly quest-owns -- which the master never saw -- passed straight
through.  Both paths now consult packages.is_quest_package.
