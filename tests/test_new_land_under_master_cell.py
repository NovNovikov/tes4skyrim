"""A NEW LAND whose parent CELL belongs to a MASTER must be nested, not dropped.

A plugin can lay BRAND-NEW terrain into a cell a master already owns. The cell
exists, so the plugin ships no CELL of its own, but the LAND is a new record
with an id in the plugin's own space -- it overrides nothing, so the override
path hands it back as "unattached" for the normal group builders.

Those builders only construct worldspaces THIS plugin defines, and the
worldspace here is the master's, so every such LAND was silently discarded.
Measured on TWMP_ValenwoodImproved.esp (masters Oblivion.esm + Tamriel.esp):
1,754 of its 2,626 LAND records name Tamriel worldspace 0000003C with a parent
CELL owned by Tamriel.esp, and all 1,754 vanished -- the output shipped 1,819
LANDs instead of 2,626. In-game the terrain never draws while the cell's
placed references still render, which is exactly the "LOD objects appear but
the land does not" symptom.

The fix routes LAND through _attach_new_records like REFR/ACHR: nested at
(6, cell), (9, cell) under the master's cell, with the parent cell anchored
from the master by emit_nested_overrides.
