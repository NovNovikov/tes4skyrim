"""`lands` is shared with the tile workers, never copied per worker.

`generate_terrain_lod` used to hand `lands` to the pool through `initializer=`,
which pickles it once PER WORKER. On Windows (spawn) that is a private copy in
every process, and the data is large: ~24 KB per cell, dominated by the 17x17
float32 opacity grids rather than the heights. Tamriel's 14,686 LAND records
pack to 329 MB, so 29 workers held ~9.5 GB of byte-identical data.

Measured on the user's 31 GB machine mid-run: 25 python processes, 22.9 GB
resident, 1.2 GB free, 13.4 GB of pagefile. The box was swapping — which is why
the symptom was LOW cpu with the stage crawling, not high cpu.

The fix publishes one copy through multiprocessing.shared_memory and rebuilds
numpy VIEWS over it in each worker. Same worker count, ~1/29th the memory:
measured 6.7 GB peak across 30 processes with 14.9 GB still free.

The contract these tests pin down is that sharing is LOSSLESS. The packed form
must reproduce every array bit-for-bit, including the alpha layer ORDER — the
layer index is dropped by `decode_land_layers` after sorting, so order is the
only thing carrying it, and a packer that rebuilt the list from a dict would
silently reorder the texture blend.
