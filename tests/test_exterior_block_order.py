"""Exterior block/sub-block GRUPs are ordered by unsigned (X, Y), X major.

The engine builds a worldspace's cell grid by walking its type-4 block list
while PARSING the plugin, before any cell loads. The list must be monotonic in
vanilla's key; a run where X descends and re-ascends never terminates, so the
game hangs on the main menu with no crash and no log.

The GRUP label packs the coordinates as `struct.pack('<hh', Y, X)` -- Y in the
LOW word. Sorting on the label's own word order therefore yields (Y, X), the
TRANSPOSE of what the engine wants, and that is what shipped.

Measured on TWMP_ValenwoodImproved.esp: Tamriel's blocks came out as
(-1,0), (-2,-3), (-2,-2), (-1,-2), (-2,-1), (-1,-1) -- three separate
ascending runs under the correct key. Deleting exterior blocks in xEdit made
the game load again, because each deletion shortens the list until what
remains happens to be monotonic; resaving in xEdit did NOT help, because xEdit
re-sorts on its own key and writes the same order back.

Authority is the real Skyrim.esm: all 168 blocks of worldspace 0000003C are
sorted by unsigned (X, Y) and by no other candidate key, as are the sub-blocks
inside every one of them and all 37 worldspaces in the file. Never census our
own converted output for this -- it carried the same bug, which is exactly how
the transposed key was mistaken for vanilla's.
