"""Folding two world-children groups must leave ONE ascending block run.

The override pass and the WRLD builder each write a `GRUP World Children`
for the same worldspace, and each sorts its own exterior blocks. Merging the
two by concatenating their bodies therefore produces one group holding TWO
ascending runs, plus a duplicate type-4 group for every block both passes
touched.

The engine walks that block list to build the worldspace's cell grid while
PARSING the file, so a descent mid-list hangs the game on the main menu with
no crash and no log -- and xEdit still reports the file as clean. Measured
before the fix: Tamriel.esp shipped 121 block groups in 15 ascending runs with
14 duplicate labels; ElsweyrAnequina.esp 8 blocks in 2 runs with 3 duplicates.
