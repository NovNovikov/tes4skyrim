# PACK Conversion Audit — 2026-08-17

Full audit of the TES4→TES5 AI-package conversion: gaps, incorrect mappings, and
same-name/different-meaning traps. Scope: `tes5_import/packages/converter.py`,
`pack_templates.py`, `pack_aliases.py`, `packages.py`,
`tes4_export/record_types/dialog_misc.py::export_PACK`, and the CTDA path in
`dialog_conditions.py`.

Every number below was **measured 2026-08-17** against `export/Oblivion.esm/`,
`export/Nehrim.esm/`, `references/Skyrim.esm/PACK.txt`, `references/xEdit`, and
the built `output/Oblivion.esm/Oblivion.esm`. Nothing here is inferred.

Companion docs: [package_ai_contracts.md](../reference/package_ai_contracts.md) (the verified
engine contracts) and [package_conversion_plan.md](../commentary/tes5_import_package.md)
(the original design).

## Gaps found

### 1. `PTDT.Type=1` (Object ID) is unhandled — 388 packages silently sandbox

> **CLOSED since this audit.** `_choose()` now branches on `t_type == 1` in
> `tes5_import/packages/converter.py` (lines 389, 803, 1204, 1259), including
> sole-placement resolution and travel/acquire routing. The finding below is
> the state on the audit date, kept as the record of what was measured.

**Highest-value fix, and mechanical.**

`pack_converter._choose()` tests `PTDT.Type == 0` only, in both the UseItemAt
branch and the Find branch. `_operate_target()` likewise returns `False` for any
non-zero PTDT type, so a type-1 target never even reaches the Activate test.
Everything else falls into the Sandbox fallback with its target discarded.

Measured (Oblivion):

| Case | Count | Target base records |
|---|---|---|
| UseItemAt (type 8) → Sandbox | 318 | MISC 232, BOOK 36, APPA 8, ALCH 7, CONT 2, STAT 2, ACTI 1, WEAP 1, unresolved 29 |
| Find (type 0) → Sandbox | 70 | NPC_ 20, WEAP 11, INGR 11, FURN 11, CONT 6, MISC 6, CREA 6, ALCH 3, … |

TES4 `PTDT.Type=1` means **Object ID** — "use/find *a* thing of this base form
nearby", not a specific placed ref. Examples: `SEZoeMelenePaintsOutside`
(MISC easel), `SEAtrabhiManiaRead` (BOOK), `SE11AlchemyStation6x4` (APPA),
`SQ01SjirraDrinks` (ALCH), `SE12GnarlFindContainers2/3` (CONT).

Skyrim has a direct expression for this and **the converter already uses it
elsewhere**: `PTDA type 2` ("Object Type") is what every vanilla Eat/Sleep
instance supplies via `build_object_type_target()`. A type-1 TES4 target maps
1:1 into `build_target()` (which already accepts types 0..2) — the branches just
never call it.

### 2. `_operate_target()` misses real object classes

`OPERABLE_SIGS = {ACTI, DOOR, CONT}`. Measured UseItemAt targets with
`PTDT.Type=0`:

```
ACTI 78   (unresolved) 8   STAT 7   FURN 2   DOOR 2
```

The **7 STAT** (`SE09RelmynaStudyAtronach`, `SE09RelmynaStudyAtronachNoVictims`,
`SE03GrummiteGnarlDancePKG`) and **8 unresolved** refs
(`MS39SinderionMakesElixir02/03/04`) fall through to `SIT_TARGET` — i.e. the
actor is told to sit on a statue, which is the same failure mode as the Renault
wall-switch bug that `_operate_target` was written to fix.

The unresolved 8 are a second-order symptom of gap 3: `_ref_base_sig` is built
only from `by_type`, so a ref whose base is not in the indexed signature set
resolves to empty and the branch cannot classify it.

Separately, `FURNITURE_SIGS = {FURN, CHAI, BED }` mixes vocabularies:
`CHAI` and `BED ` are **TES5 `wbObjectTypeEnum` names, not TES4 record
signatures**. No TES4 record ever carries them, so only `FURN` can ever match.
Harmless today (the fallthrough is Activate, which is usually right) but the set
is misleading and should be `{FURN}` with a comment, or extended properly.

### 3. `PackagePlan.build()` is master-blind

`import_main.py` Phase 0g builds the plan from **`by_type` alone**:

```python
pack_plan.build(by_type,
                {get_formid(r, 'FormID') for r in by_type.get('QUST', [])},
                _sv_owner)
```

…while `load_package_types(by_type, _master_export)` and
`build_script_var_map(by_type, _master_export)` on the *adjacent lines* both take
the master export. `_base_sig` / `_ref_base_sig` in the same phase are likewise
built from `by_type` only.

Consequences for any plugin with masters (Morrowind_ob and the ESPs; Nehrim and
Oblivion are standalone):

* a master-owned QUST is absent from `quest_fids`, so a package gated on it gets
  no `owner_quest` → no QNAM, no ALPC, no alias routing;
* a master-owned ACHR/ACRE is absent from `base_to_ref`, so the actor gets no
  alias and its quest packages fall back to the standing schedule;
* a master-owned base record is absent from `_base_sig`, so `_operate_target`
  and the actor-Find branch silently take the Sandbox fallback.

Confirmed on `Morrowind_ob - Chargen and Transport Mod.esp`: 12 own PACK records
but **14 AIPackage references**, 2 of them master-owned (`0002C81C`).
`load_package_types` already covers those 2; the *plan* does not.

This is the recurring defect named in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#master-blindness).

### 4. 48 packages lose their entire condition gate

Measured through the production path
(`convert_ctda_list_with_strings` with a real `script_vars` map):

| Plugin | Packages w/ conditions | CTDAs | Kept | Dropped | Lost ALL conditions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oblivion.esm | 3,874 | 6,172 | 6,054 | 118 (1.9%) | **48** |
| Nehrim.esm | 812 | 1,141 | 1,141 | 0 (0.0%) | 0 |

Dropping a condition **fails open**. That is defensible for dialogue (Oblivion's
call site already chose speaker+topic) but it is *inverted* for a package: an
ungated package runs whenever it reaches the top of the actor's list.

The 48 split cleanly by cause:

* **34 × func 53 `GetScriptVariable`** whose variable name could not be resolved
  through REFR → base → SCRI → SCPT. `SE08XedVictim01..05GreetPlayer` and
  `...Flee` now force-greet / flee unconditionally.
* **14 × func 171 `IsPlayerInJail`** — Oblivion-only, no TES5 equivalent, so it
  is correctly in `_FUNC_DROP`. But every city's `ChorrolJailorWanderPlayerInJail`,
  `AnvilJailorWanderPlayerInJail`, `ICPrisonJailorNightPatrol`,
  `BravilJailorNightPickpocket` etc. now runs **always** instead of only while
  the player is jailed.

For func 171 there is a real TES5 expression available (the jail/prison state is
reachable via faction/quest state or a `GetInCell` on the prison cell); for func
53 the fix is to widen the script-var resolution rather than to drop.

A package that loses its last condition should arguably be given a
never-passing gate instead of an always-passing one — the Oblivion behaviour
"only under condition X" is closer to "never" than to "always" when X is
untranslatable.

### 5. Escort/Follow discard the authored `PLDT.Radius`

`build_location()` preserves radius correctly, but both escort paths —
Follow-with-location → `ESCORT` and plain `T4_ESCORT` — set only
`target`/`location`/`ride_horse` and leave the template's default spacing
(`120.0` / `256.0` / `512.0` from `ESCORT.defaults`).

TES4's `PLDT.Radius` on an escort is the **arrival radius**, and arrival is what
ENDS the package — `OnPackageEnd` is where these quests advance.
`CGEmperorToMarkerB` authors radius 70. This is the same class of bug as the
original Follow→Escort routing fix (which was made because Follow "never
ARRIVES"), one level down.

## Scale

Template distribution in the built ESM (`output/Oblivion.esm/Oblivion.esm`,
7,209 PKCU records):

```
Sandbox   2878      Follow       231      FleeTo     11
Travel    2156      ForceGreet   153      SitTarget  10
Eat        829      Activate     113      UseMagic    5
Sleep      725      Escort        98
```

**2,878 packages (40%) land on Sandbox**, of which ~1,167 are Find/UseItemAt
fallbacks that discarded a target (513 Find + 654 UseItemAt per
`tools/esm/pack_audit.py`). Gap 1 alone accounts for 388 of them.

## Reproducing

```bash
python tools/esm/pack_audit.py --export export/Oblivion.esm      # template routing + data loss
python tools/esm/pack_validate.py output/Oblivion.esm/Oblivion.esm --summary
python tools/esm/pack_template_dump.py --list                    # vanilla template roots
```

The PTDT/PLDT censuses and the condition-drop measurement were ad-hoc reads of
`export/<plugin>/PACK.txt` plus `dialog_conditions.convert_ctda_list_with_strings`;
if they need to be repeated often they belong in `pack_audit.py` as new flags
rather than in a fresh script.
