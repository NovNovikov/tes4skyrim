// Morrowind's attribute step on top of Skyrim's own level-up.
//
// Skyrim keeps the skills and decides when the player levels. This keeps
// what Morrowind adds: every skill increase is credited to its GOVERNING
// attribute (the SKIL record's), and each level the player gains is a pending
// step where three attributes rise by the multiplier those credits earned
// (iLevelUp01Mult..iLevelUp10Mult), as OpenMW's NpcStats does.
//
// Everything lives in DialogueState's variables, so it rides the co-save.
