// What the player's Morrowind attributes do in Skyrim while the character

// and a half.

//   Intelligence  Magicka from each Magicka pick       } at the level-up step,
//   Endurance     Health from each Health pick         } from the BASE
//   Agility       Stamina from each Stamina pick       } attribute; never
//   Strength      carry weight from each Stamina pick  } retroactive
//   Willpower     Magicka regen (MagickaRateMult)      } always, from the
//   Speed         Stamina regen (StaminaRateMult)      } attribute as magic
//   Luck          critical chance, (Luck - 50) / 10    } moves it
//
// A Fortify or Drain moves the pick buffs too, for as long as it lasts: each
// point is 1/100 of a pick's amount for every pick of that pool so far.
//
// Every buff is HELD: the runtime remembers what it added to each Skyrim
// value and moves the value by the difference, so turning the sheet off hands
// every point back.
