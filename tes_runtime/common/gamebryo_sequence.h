// Playing a NiControllerSequence that lives inside a mesh, the way
// ObjectReference.PlayGamebryoAnimation does: the NiControllerManager on a
// node, its name map, NiControllerSequence::Activate / ::Deactivate. No
// behaviour graph is involved, so it works on any mesh that carries a manager.
//
// Layout verified on 1.6.1170 against NiControllerSequence's constructor
// (0xd90360): weight +0x30, cycle type +0x40, frequency +0x44, begin key time
// +0x48 (initialised FLT_MAX), end key time +0x4c (-FLT_MAX), owner +0x60,
// state +0x68; Activate (0xd92eb0) refuses a sequence whose state is not 0.
// (docs/commentary/asset_convert_falloutnv.md#gun-parts)
//
// Time: Update (0xd92540) feeds `time + offset` (+0x6c, -FLT_MAX until the
// first update sets it to -time) to ComputeScaledTime (0xd93be0), which adds
// its change since last time (+0x50) to the weighted time (+0x54). An
// immediate Deactivate (0xd93030) folds the played time into the offset, and
// Activate without start-over keeps the offset, so a resumed sequence goes on
// as if it had kept playing unless the paused time is taken back out.
