"""Author-intent diffing between a master's export and a plugin's export.

The rule for converting an override is: take the master's CONVERTED record
exactly, then replace only the fields the plugin's AUTHOR changed. This module
answers "what did the author change?" — and it answers it from the two TES4
exports, never by comparing two conversion runs.

Why that distinction matters. Diffing conversions conflates two things:

    the author changed this field        (real override content)
    our pass re-derived it differently   (an artifact of less context)

and the converter cannot tell them apart. Nehrim's Translation.esp made that
concrete: comparing conversions reported 1821 changed NPC_ `RNAM` values, so
every NPC's race was rewritten to a vanilla Skyrim race and the game hung on
load. Comparing exports reports ZERO changed RNAMs, because the author never
touched a single one. A field that neither export changes can never drift.

Order-insensitivity is the other half. Oblivion does not preserve list order
between a master and a plugin that overrides it: 1166 of 1264 Nehrim NPC_
inventories differ positionally while only 5 differ as a set. A positional
diff would rewrite 1161 inventories for no reason.
