"""Versioned pipeline artifacts: the JSON one stage writes and another reads.

The export/asset stages hand data to the import stage through JSON files on
disk.  Those files outlive the run that wrote them -- and, when a plugin has a
TES4 master, they outlive the PLUGIN that wrote them: a dependent plugin reads
its master's `creature_projects.json` and never rewrites it.  So a file on disk
can predate the code reading it by an arbitrary amount.

Add a required field to a producer and every existing file becomes unreadable.
Before this module that surfaced as a bare `KeyError` from deep inside a
builder, naming neither the file nor the plugin whose stage had to be re-run
(commit a4fdb47 added `behavior_hkx` to creature_projects.json; DLCFrostcrag
then died in creature_idles with `KeyError: 'behavior_hkx'`, pointing at
DLCFrostcrag when the stale file belonged to Oblivion.esm).

An artifact written here carries an envelope::

    {"version": 1, "plugin": "Oblivion.esm", "stage": "--creatures-only",
     "data": {...}}

`plugin` and `stage` exist to make the failure ACTIONABLE.  The consumer cannot
infer either one: the file may belong to a master, and only the producer knows
which `convert.py` flag rebuilds it.  Without them the error can name a problem
but not its fix.

Two independent checks, because a version is only as good as the discipline
that bumps it:

  * `version` mismatch -- the deliberate signal.  A file with no `version` key
    is v0 (every file written before this module existed), so old files are
    rejected cleanly instead of being half-read.
  * `required` keys missing from any entry -- the backstop for a required field
    added WITHOUT a version bump, which is the mistake that caused the original
    bug.  tests/test_artifact_schema.py catches the same slip at development
    time; this catches it on a user's machine.

Not every JSON file belongs here.  A pure CACHE (mesh bounds, extracted-BSA
bookkeeping, voice durations) is recomputable, so a stale one should be
discarded and rebuilt, never fatal -- `collision_extract.BOUNDS_SCHEMA_VERSION`
already does that with an in-band `__schema__` sentinel and is left alone.
Register an artifact here only when losing it means losing AUTHORED work the
consumer cannot rebuild by itself.

`master_manifest.py` predates this and carries its own equivalent envelope; its
remap logic is load-bearing (see the TWMP Valenwood note there) and is not
migrated.
