"""Every converted actor's TES4 attributes and kept skills, as hidden faction ranks.

Skyrim has no attribute actor values. Each attribute, and each skill the sheet
keeps (Athletics, Hand-to-Hand, Acrobatics), is a hidden conversion-owned
faction; a converted NPC_ or creature joins each at its authored value, so a
dialogue condition reads it with GetFactionRank and a script with
Get/SetFactionRank, with or without MorrowindRuntime. Factions never make
their members allies: 200 of Skyrim.esm's 1,084 factions list themselves as
Ally because membership alone does not.
